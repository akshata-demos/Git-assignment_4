  Types of Puri Chaat ->
* Dahi Puri (or Dahi Batata Puri): Originating in Mumbai, this version uses the small, hollow puri shells also used for pani puri. 
  They are filled with ingredients like boiled potatoes, chickpeas, onions, and various chutneys, then generously topped with whisked 
  yogurt (dahi), spices (like chaat masala), and thin crunchy noodles called sev. 
  It offers a mix of sweet, tangy, and spicy flavors.

* Masala Puri: This popular South Indian street food, especially in Bangalore, features crushed puris mixed with a spicy and savory green 
  pea and potato gravy or curry (ragda). It is often garnished with chopped onions, tomatoes, coriander leaves, and sev before serving.

* Sev Puri: While sometimes made with hollow puris, it often uses small, flat, crispy puris (papris). Loadings typically include diced 
  potatoes, chickpeas, and tomatoes, but unlike dahi puri, it is usually served without yogurt and relies on various chutneys and a 
  generous amount of sev for its flavor and texture.
